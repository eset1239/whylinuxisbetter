title: Books & printing industry</h2>

<p>Linux software still has very experimental CMYK features. This is getting better, but it's 
not really satisfying for professional use yet.</p>

<p>While most books and magazines about free software switched to Linux 
a long time ago (and don't they look great ?!), if you work in the 
printing industry and use a lot of CMYK colors, with subtle images, 
special printing effects, etc., you probably should stick to Windows for 
now. But you can still install Linux, keep Windows (see the install 
section), and use both of them, depending on your needs.</p>

<p>Note that you can also use am image editor called
<a href="http://www.kanzelsberger.com/pixel/">Pixel</a>, which supports
CMYK. However, I still believe that Linux isn't ready for prime time in
the printing industry just yet.</p>
