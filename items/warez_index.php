<h2>Why copy software illegally if you can get it for free?</h2>

<p>So, you're perfectly clean, you have *cough* purchased a license for all the software you've ever used *cough*, 
and nobody can bother you about this? Well, if that's the case, congratulations :)</p>

<p>However, for most people, let's be honest, illegally copied software 
is very common. Copying Adobe Photoshop instead of buying it probably 
doesn't let you have nightmares. But are you really confident that you 
won't ever have trouble for that? Not so sure, huh... Software makers 
are progressing and finding more and more ways to track down illegal 
owners, and since more and more people tend to have broadband 
(permanent) connections, they might add an online functionality on the 
software that will control and verify your copy each time you launch 
it.</p>

<p>If you run Linux and install free software, you won't have to worry 
about this ever again! Most of free (as in free speech) software is 
free (as in free beer). You can find a free replacement for most of the 
commercial software out there. They might lack some of the advanced 
functionality, but they'll be more than enough for most people. 
Here's a list of some commercial software, and their open source 
equivalents :</p>
