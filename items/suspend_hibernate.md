<h2>Save some energy : let your computer sleep or hibernate.</h2>

<ul>
<li>Windows allows "sleep" and "hibernate" (for the latter, hold the Shift key down when you see the shutdown 
dialog).</li>
<li>Mac OS X only allows "sleep".</li>
</ul>

<p>While your computer is sleeping, you can't use it, but it's consuming 
very little power, and you can wake it up by pressing a key or clicking 
the mouse.</p>

<p>Of course, Linux lets you do this as well, but it also lets you 
"hibernate" your computer. Hibernation is pretty much like sleeping, but 
your computer won't be using any power at all: you can even unplug it, 
it won't do any harm. This is especially useful for laptops : whenever 
you need to move some place else, just hibernate your computer, unplug 
it, and when you give it power again, you'll find things just as you had 
left them.</p>

<p>So basically, you just don't need to "boot" your computer again! 
Since Linux is very stable and seldom needs to reboot, you can just boot 
it once and for all, then just hibernate, wake up, hibernate, wake up, 
etc.</p>
