<h2>Enjoy free and unlimited support</h2>

<p>One of the great assets of the Open Source community (and Linux 
in particular), is that it's a real community. Users and developers 
really are out there, on web forums, on mailing lists, on IRC channels, 
helping out new users. They're all happy to see more and more people 
switch to Linux, and they're happy to help them get a grip on their new 
system. </p>

<p>So if there's something you don't understand, a program that doesn't 
behave the way you would expect, or a feature that you can't seem to 
find, don't hesitate to go and ask for help. If there's somebody near 
you (family? co-workers?) who is using Linux, he or she will probably be 
happy to help you out. Otherwise, just go online and you'll find
literally thousands of places where nice people will answer you and walk
you out of your problem most of the time: geeks actually are very nice
people, if you ask your question politely. Just type "linux help" (or
replace "linux" with whatever distribution you chose -- see the install 
section) in Google and you'll undoubtedly find everything you need.</p>
