<h2>Why does your Windows get slower day after day?</h2>

<p>Windows has a number of design flaws, resulting in it becoming
slower and slower and not lasting very long. You've probably
heard more than once 
someone say "My computer is getting sluggish, I'm gonna reinstall". 
Reinstalling Windows solves the problem... until next time.</p>

<p>You may think this is just how computers work: they're very new 
technology, and not really stable yet. Well, try Linux and you'll be 
surprised. Five years from now, your system will be just as fast and 
responsive as the day you installed it, not to mention that you won't 
have any viruses, adware, trojans, worms, etc., that would force you to 
reinstall anyway.</p>

<p>I have managed to convince many people to switch to Linux, while 
keeping Windows on their hard disk, because they needed to use some 
piece of software that Linux doesn't have (eg Autocad), so they use both 
systems. Since the day they switched, most of them have reinstalled 
Windows about once in a year or two; but Linux didn't let them down, 
and is still running perfectly well and is still snappy today.</p>

<p>Linux lets you spend more time working, less time reinstalling over 
and over again.</p>
