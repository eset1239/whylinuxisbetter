<h2>Need new software? Don't bother searching the web, Linux gets it for you.</h2>

<p>If you want to check out a new piece of software in Windows, you'll 
need to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Search the web to find which piece of software suits your needs.</li>
<li>Find a web site that allows you to download it.</li>
<li>Maybe pay for it.</li>
<li>Actually download the software.</li>
<li>Install it.</li>
<li>Sometimes reboot your computer.</li>
</ol>

<p>Whew, that's a lot of work to just try out something new!</p>

<p>With Linux, everything is <b>much simpler</b>. Linux has what is 
called a "package manager": each piece of software is contained in its 
own "package". If you need some new software, just open the package 
manager, type a few keywords, choose which software you want to install 
and press "Apply" or "OK". Or you can just browse existing software 
(that's a lot of choice!) in categories.</p>

<p>So one: no more surfing. Two: no more downloading and installing 
software yourself. Three: more time to actually try out the software.</p>
