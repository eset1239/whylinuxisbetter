Hi Manu,

       congratulations for your website "whylinuxisbetter.net". Well 
done, nice sense of humour, simple yet nice graphics, etc, etc... I am a 
GNU/Linux advocate and member of the FSF, and I will definitively add 
you website in my talks now.

       One suggestion/reflection for the entry on Environment: I am 
under the impression that the biggest impact on environment in 
proprietary software relies
 more on the production process, rather than on the final product.

       Take the example of Windows. In order for MS to have their 
business going they had to build facilities around the world, they have 
dozens of thousands of staff members travelling daily, they produce huge 
amount of gadgets and advertising material to persuade people their 
product is good, organise promotional conventions with attendees coming 
from all around the world, ship material around the planet, etc...

       CO2 emissions/fuel consumption could be a straightforward element 
to use to make the point in a simple form on your website: M$ uses oil 
to commute its employees, build their compounds, build the 
infrastructures needed around it, powering the facilities, flying people 
around the globe, moving goods around the words, producing gadgets, etc, 
etc, etc....

       In terms of being simple in the presentation, it looks like you 
are far more skilled than me, a possibility could be to focus on even 
only one factor. For example: fuel consumption for commuting employees. 
Microsoft has 79.000 employees (April 2007). Take a [conservative] 
average of 1 litre of fuel per day per employee. Take 5 days per week, 
46 weeks per year, and a production cycle for windows of 3 years... it 
gives over 90 million litres of fuel used just to move the employees for 
the time needed to deploy a new version of windows.
       You could then make a funny comparison. For example, knowing that 
one CD weight 16 grams, and that to produce a unit of plastic you need 
about two of oil, you could deduce that you could use that fuel to 
produce around 2,8 billions ubuntu CD's. Roughly one for every second 
person on the planet.

* Search for "installing Linux on another hard drive" on Gmail, addition to the installation page.

On this page:
http://www.whylinuxisbetter.net/items/warez/index.php?lang=
you describe some open-source alternatives for commercial Windows
applications, but on a few of the options you have listed no open-source
app existing on Windows. I know you want to make people switch, as do I,
but I think you should also list open-source Windows-apps equivalent to
the commercial app.

After some quick googling, I found this:

Adobe Premiere - Avidemux (Linux, Mac OSX, Windows)
Adobe Reader - Sumatra PDF (Windows only)
Apple iTunes - aTunes (Java-program), Amarok, Songbird, SqueezeCenter
(Windows, Mac, Linux, BSD and Solaris)
Nero - InfraRecorder, cdrtfe

Just couldn't find any open-source replacements for Windows under Palm
Desktop. I don't even know what Palm Desktop is, so that may be it. What
I did find was this website: www.palmopensource.com which may or may not
contain a replacement.

Some remarks from the Dutch translator

GAIM: Please delete MSN from the list, replace it by Facebook Chat and IRC
FAQ: Please delete Cedega and replace it by CrossOver and PlayOnLinux
FAQ: Next year I'm gonna open source my automatic project generator. (hmm, that has crossed the deadline, I presume?)
Backdoors: a little while ago (2008) => just remove the little :D
Environment: Mac OS => Mac OS X
Environment: Mac OS X is no longer being sold on DVD (download too)
Environment: Linux also needs to be burnt on a CD before
installation (in most cases at least -- installation from the network
or from a hard disk is also quite common) --> Please note that USB can also be used (UNetBootin)
Hardcore gamer: replace Cedega with CrossOver and PlayOnLinux
Viruses: <i>much</i> fewer => <i>much fewer</i>
Install: please mention DVD as a medium to burn to
Try: please mention DVD, please provide a range of sizes (650MB to 1.5GB)
Oneday: add to Evolution also Geary
Oneday: replace Openoffice by LibreOffice
Oneday: replace Hotmail by Outlook.com
Oneday: "If you need something that's not installed yet" (later in this sentence, there if for => from). Also, this is no longer valid since Ubuntu now uses Unity Dash.
Oneday: (instant messaging/online chat) but many others are available => add between brackets like Pidgin (it's very popular)
Oneday: ShotWell => Shotwell
