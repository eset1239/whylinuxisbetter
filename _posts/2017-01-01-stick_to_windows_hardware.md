Most pieces of hardware work just fine with Linux. However, very 
recent hardware (a few months old) are sometimes not yet supported. Like 
software vendors, many hardware vendors still consider the Linux market 
as a very small one, and don't bother to provide Linux drivers for their 
hardware. The Linux developers work on that, and do a terrific work to 
let every piece of hardware work like a charm, but this takes a little 
time.

The best and most straightforward way to see whether your 
hardware is well supported is to run Linux from a Live CD (see the 
"Try Linux without touching Windows" section).
