title: Try a "Live CD"

You can try Linux for real without even needing to touch your 
hard disk, without needing to do anything to your existing Windows !

This is possible with "Linux live distributions". A live distribution works the 
following way :

<ul>

<li>Download a disk image from the web (this will be an <tt>.iso</tt> 
file, usually around 700 MB). </li>

<li>Copy the image onto a USB stick (don't just copy the file, individual
    distributions should tell you how to do you).</li>

<li>Plug in your USB drive, and reboot.</li>

<li>You will need to tell your computer to boot from the USB drive instead
of booting from the 
hard drive (where Windows is), and when it does it will <b>not touch anything</b> : 
don't worry about Windows and your data, they'll still be there when you 
reboot again without the drive. </li>

<li>If your computer still boots Windows (the drive doesn't seem to 
have any effect), then your BIOS configuration is faulty: you need to 
ask it to first scan the USB devices for an operating system, and then the 
hard drive. You can usually access the BIOS by typing "Del" or "F2" 
while booting (if you don't feel comfortable with this, get some 
help).</li>

<li>And voil√†, Linux runs on your system, you can test it and see 
how you like it! Don't worry if the system seems a bit slow right 
now: it takes some time to load everything from the drive. Your Linux 
system will be much quicker once actually installed on your hard disk. 
</li>

</ul>

So, where can you download those drive images ? There are a lot of 
Linux Live distributions available on the web ! You could try one of these for 
example:
