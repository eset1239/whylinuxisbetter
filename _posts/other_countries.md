<h2>Help other countries, and your own</h2>

<p>Microsoft is an USA company, and its success is great for the 
American economy.</p>

<p>But if you don't live in the USA, when you buy propietary software 
(eg Windows), about a half of the money goes directly to the software 
company's HQ (eg Microsoft's): that money leaves your country, while the 
other half stays in (sales commissions, etc.: no technical benefits). 
Your country is not producing anything, and you don't even need 
qualified people to sell boxes. That leads to IT professionals with no 
high level knowledge who only install and configure proprietary software 
without the option of modifying/learning/customizing it.</p>

<p>With Free Software (eg Linux), the economy (and IT professionals' 
knowledge) of your country could improve, since there could be a lot of 
small/medium companies customizing solutions, providing support, 
consulting, etc.</p>

<p>People who know how to do things and retain money in your country 
will benefit from it, rather than people who just sell boxes with a 
predefined sales pitch, sending your money offshore, leaving IT professionals 
without real knowledge about how things work.</p>
