<h2>Update all your software with a single click.</h2>

<p>Windows has a pretty convenient tool called "Windows update", which 
allows you to update your system with the latest updates available.</p>

<p>But what about all your non-Microsoft software? Adobe applications? 
ZIP compresser? Burning program? Non-Microsoft web browsers and email 
clients, etc.? You need to update all of them, one by one. And that 
takes time, since each one of them has its own (auto-)updating 
system.</p>

<p>Linux has a central place called the "Package manager", which takes 
care of everything installed on your system, but also every 
single piece of software your computer has. So if you want to keep 
<i>everything</i> up-to-date, the only thing you need to do is press the 
"Install Updates" button down there :</p>
