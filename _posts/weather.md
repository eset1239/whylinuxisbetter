<h2>Keep an eye on the weather.</h2>

Are you tired of having a thermometer outside your window and go 
check it before getting out? Just take a look at your Linux screen and 
keep an eye on the weather :

<img src="Images/weather.png" />

Of course, Linux doesn't force you to do anything, so you can place 
this anywhere you want on your screen, or just not have it at all (after 
all, isn't it nicer to have a look through your window?). You can 
select the place where you live (or anywhere else) in a complete list of 
locations (OK, I cheated, I chose Honolulu for the screen capture, it's 
2Â°C right now in Paris!).
